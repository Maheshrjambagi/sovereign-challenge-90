# Engineering Log - Day 4

## What I learned today

- **Git**: Learned how to initialize a repository, stage changes, commit, and push to a remote on GitHub.
- **Optical Engineering**: Reflected on how light, lenses, and optical systems can be used as an analogy for focusing and directing information in engineering work.

## Key takeaways

- **Version control** keeps a history of changes and lets teams collaborate safely.
- **Optical concepts** like focus and alignment mirror how engineers should align tools and processes with project goals.
